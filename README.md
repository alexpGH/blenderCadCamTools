# blenderCadCamTools
Python scripts and blender files for 3d construction of airfoils, hydrofoils, surfboards etc.

See my site [foss-toolchain-mpcnc](https://alexpgh.github.io/foss-toolchain-mpcnc) for some tutorials around cad/cam with free and open source tools, applied for my airfoil and hydrofoil designs.
